---- Flow for spawning common interactable assets (players, items, etc) ----

1. Client sends call to server announcing it wants to create an item/player

2. Server replicates call and sends to all other clients

3. All clients acknowledge that common asset has been spawned

4. Owning client sets network_master of player to itself to begin replication among all other clients

- this prevents the issue of clients crashing due to receiving rpc calls for a player that has not yet been spawned
- first check if network_master is itself by default, if so, set to null
